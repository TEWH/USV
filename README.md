# UltraBlind
Ultrasonic Vision for the Blind: 90% of the world's blind and visually impaired live in developing countries. Although canes are a common solution, learning to navigate with a cane takes 3-12 months of training. Because of this, we intend to develop a device consisting of ultrasonic sensors placed on various body parts to allow greater mobility for visually impaired individuals
